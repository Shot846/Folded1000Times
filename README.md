Current status: Beta (a few placeholder graphics, plenty of features need polishing, a few more to be included)

HOW 2 INSTALL

If you already have a source port: Download zip (handy link to the right), run _zip.bat

If you don't know all this newfangled Doom terminology:
- Acquire doom.wad and/or doom2.wad (Doom2.wad allows you to play more mapsets)
- Acquire source port (I suggest Zandronum ( http://zandronum.com/ ) or ZDoom/GZDoom ( http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/zdoom/ || http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/gzdoom/ )
- Click, drag and drop current DemonSteele .pk3 on top of Zandronum.exe or ZDoom.exe or GZDoom.exe.
- If you want to play with a custom mapset, hold ctrl, click to select DemonSteele and mapset, drag both and drop onto .exe.
- Enjoy.

HOW 2 PLAY

Primary fire uses Kharon for melee, secondary fire uses gun. Kharon can cut down enemy projectiles.<br>
Top-right meter is combo meter, goes up as you land hits on enemies. Higher ranks increases sword damage.<br>
Bottom-left meter is soul meter, goes up as you kill enemies with the sword and drain their soul. Two notches are needed for special attacks.<br>
Hold down fire to ready up. Double-tap a direction while readying to do a special attack.<br>
Hold Run and a direction to dodge in that direction, passing harmlessly through projectiles.<br>

Why did I fork this? I replaced the dash code so it doesn't use byteangle, now it uses High Noon Drifter's implementation, so the dashing is accurate.
